## Python
Python Datatypes

### Overview:
Python supports **Dynamic Type Bindings**. That means, - we can declare variable with one datatype and 
change type of value on next line. 
Example, - 
 ```markdown
  myString = 10
  print("Number value from myString variable - " + myString)
  myString = "Ten"
  print("String value from myString variable - " + Ten)
 ```
**Pros of Dynamic Type Bindings:**
- Very easy to work with
- Faster development time.

**Cons of Dynamic Type Bindings:**
- May result in *bugs* for unexcepted data types!
- you need to be aware of type()
