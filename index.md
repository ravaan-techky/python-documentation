## Python
Python Implementation

### Overview:
High Level Programming Language
- Dynamic
- Readability
- Iterpreted Language
- Multi Paradigm Language Support (It support Object Oriented and Procedure Oriented Concepts)

### Language is base on philosophy:
```markdown
- Beautiful is better than Ugly.
- Explicit is better than Implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than Complicated
- Increase Readability counts
```

### Features
- Developers can learn it quickly.
- Typically involves less code
- Syntax is easier to read
- Utilized by every major technology company.
- Huge amount of additional Open-Source libraries.

### What we can do with Python
- Automated Simple Tasks
  - Searching for files & editing them
  - Scraping informattion from from website
  - Reading and editing excel files
  - Works with PDFs
  - Automated Emails and text messages
  - Fill out the forms.  
- Data Science & Machine Learning
  - Analyzing large data files [Numpy & Pandas]
  - Creating visualization [Matplotlib & Seaborn]
  - Perform machine learning task [Plotly & touchup flow]
  - Create and run predicitive algorithms [Plotly & touchup flow]
- Create website
  - Use web framework such as Django & flask to handle backend of website & user data.
  - Creating an interactive Dashboard for users.
